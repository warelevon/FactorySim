## This is currently a testing script. The plan is to move functions to src files
using JEMSS, FactorySim, Distributions, Graphs

# test graph inputs for conjunctive and disjunctive graphs

## STEP 0:
# Set variables
rootElt = xmlFileRoot("C:\\Users\\dd\\.julia\\v0.6\\FactorySim\\example\\sim_config.xml") #hard coded for now
simElt = findElt(rootElt, "sim")
n = parse(Int, eltContent(simElt, "numMachines"))
m = collect(1:n)

####### STEP 1:
# Set  M_0
m0 = Int64[]
# Find Cmax for the graph with only conjuctive arcs, no disjunctive arcs
s1 = Graphs.bellman_ford_shortest_paths(gc, eweights1, [1])
cMax = maximum(-s1.dists)
length(m0)

####### STEP 2:
# Used for the filter() function in step 2
if length(m0)==0
    a = 0
else
    a = m0[1]
end
@assert isinteger(a) && a>=0
#iterate through machines in the set m-m0
for i=1:length(m)-length(m0)
    mDash = filter!(m->mâ‰ a,m)
    println("machines evaluated are: ",mDash)
